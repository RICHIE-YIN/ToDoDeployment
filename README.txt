TO-DO-LIST is a relatively simple task-keeping application. It is different from other to-do lists as it allows you to add 
items to the list, and each item can have tasks, which in turn can have steps.

This was one of my first projects. The app was built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. My main challenge with this 
project was marking steps and tasks as complete. After a little bit of tinkering, I was able to figure it out.

Breakdown of how this app works:

- Users can add an item to the list.
- Within that list, users can create tasks.
- In the tasks, users can add multiple steps to complete the task.
- Users can then mark any steps, tasks, or items on the list as complete.
